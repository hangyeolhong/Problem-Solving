### Python solution
```python
def solution(n, times):
    answer = 0
    start, end = 0, max(times) * n
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        people = 0
        for time in times:
            people += mid // time
        
            if people >= n:
                break
        
        if people >= n:
            answer = mid
            end = mid - 1
        elif people < n:
            # 시간을 늘려야함
            start = mid + 1
    return answer
```
