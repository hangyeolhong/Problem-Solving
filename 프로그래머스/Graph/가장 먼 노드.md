### Python solution
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(n, edge):
    answer = 1
    
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for x, y in edge:
        graph[x - 1].append(y - 1)
        graph[y - 1].append(x - 1)
    
    q = deque()
    q.append(0) # 0번 노드부터 시작
    visit = set()
    visit.add(0)
    dist = [0] * n
    
    # bfs
    while q:
        x = q.popleft()
        
        for neighbor in graph[x]:
            if neighbor not in visit:
                visit.add(neighbor)
                q.append(neighbor)
                dist[neighbor] = dist[x] + 1
                
    dist.sort(reverse = True)

    for i in range(1, n):
        if dist[i] == dist[0]:
            answer += 1
        else:
            break
            
    return answer
```
