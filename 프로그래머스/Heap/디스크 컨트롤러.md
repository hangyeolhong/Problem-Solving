### Python solution
```python
import heapq

def solution(jobs):
    answer = 0
    start, end = -1, 0
    q = []
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(jobs):
        for required_time, total_time in jobs:
            if start < required_time <= end:
                heapq.heappush(q, (total_time, required_time))
                
        if q:
            cur = heapq.heappop(q)
            start = end
            end  += cur[0]
            answer += (end - cur[1])
            i += 1
            
        else:
            end += 1
    return answer // len(jobs)
```
